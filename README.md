## COURSE DETAILS
This course covers the theoretical foundations as well as practical techniques for the construction of a compiler for a high-level programming language. Topics include lexical analysis, parsing, type checking, code generation, and optimization. Students will implement an actual compiler for a high-level programming language.

Topics
- Formal-language theory: alphabets, words, languages, regular expressions, finite automata
- Compiler design and implementation principles
- Lexical Analysis: scanners, symbol tables
- Parsing: context-free grammars, parse trees, ambiguity, top-down and bottom-up parsing
- LL(1) parsing: efficient top-down parsing, left-factoring
- Shift-reduce and table-driven parsers: bottom-up parsing
- Type checking: typing rules, types as inferencing rules, Context checking for programs
- Context and code generation: from high-level to machine code
- Introduction to optimization: local, global, and interprocedural.
